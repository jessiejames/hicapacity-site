### What is HI Capacity? ###
#### _We're transforming dreamers into doers._ ####

[Feel free to stop by any night to check us out! We are located in the Manoa Innovation Center. Enter through the front walkway, follow the side walk to your second door on the right. When you take the first left in the hallway, you will see our door on the right.]

We've been meeting a lot of people in the community recently. Whether it was at the [Hawaii Geek Meet](http://hawaiigeek.com/), or our first/[second](http://www.facebook.com/media/set/fbx/?set=a.150614461670608.37454.138211559577565) electronic Arduino night, we often hear people asking what exactly is a Hackerspace?  We know the name sounds extremely intimidating &mdash; shoot, it even intimidates us at times!  We wanted to clear up the confusion on what exactly we are and what we're trying to do on Oahu.

If you search on Google, a Hackerspace is often defined as

> [Hackerspaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) are community-operated physical places, where people can meet and work on their projects. (from http://hackerspaces.org)

 Initially, we focused on electronics, but we've quickly realized that there's no reason to be so specialized.  We're branching out, reaching out to those passionate about fostering an environment that creates value, and forming "Community Nights".

**So what is a Community Night?**

A Community Night is a meetup organized around a particular community group.  So far, we've managed to find organizers for the following Community Nights (and we would <3 more):

* Electronic hacking night with Arduino
* Hardware night (Tuesdays)
* Game night (Wednesdays)
* Programming night (Thursdays)<br>
####Feel free to drop in any night to check it out!####

Ideas for other community nights include: Photography night, Craft night, Cooking night, Arduino night, 3D print night, Ladies night, and we're open to Ideas!  Why Community Nights?  We want to help get those that are passionate about a topic in front of those that want to learn.  We want to help reduce the friction!

At HI Capacity, we focus on providing education and raising the awareness of all these topics in the local community.

If you're passionate about a subject and would love to help organize a Community Night, we're always looking for you.

**Please get in touch with us at (hello [at] hicapacity [dot] org)!**

We want to raise the bar and level of knowledge here in the islands.  What better way than to teach and connect like-minded people who share the same passion?

We're at an exciting time... and we hope you'll want to be a part of it, too!

The video below shows HI Capacity's humble beginnings. Even though we have moved to a new space, the goal of HI Capacity remains unchanged. Listen to co-founders Matthew Badeau, Austen Ito, and Jason Axelson talk about what HI Capacity is and what they hope HI Capacity accomplishes.

James Wang will be giving us an update on how he's using Javascript to build web applications.  He'll also talk a bit about the language in general and what makes it tick.  Topics to include:

* DOM Manipulation
* [The Good Parts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook)
* Popular Uses
* Example code

Did you know that Javascript has good parts and bad parts? Find out how to use the good parts and ignore everything else. Javascript is in a renaissance. Find out how to take part.

Demos: JQuery, Underscore, Angular.js, Node.js

Goals for this talk:

1. Educate the tech community about Javascript framework choices (browser).
2. Using the language effectively and avoiding the bad parts.
3. Node.js performance and relevance.

As many of you know, we're trying to obtain a permanent space here in Honolulu. As a makerspace, our goal is to share our creative talents and ideas in both physical and non-physical aspects in a place where we feel comfortable. Whether it's creating a tweeting robot, building a web app that displays real time tidal statistics, or just learning from people who are doing these projects, we want to provide a great social setting for all members.

This is where we need your help. We need to raise money to start the space. At the moment, we have a lot of inactive members but we need to find out who's willing to participate and help fund the space. Our goal is $10,000 in startup costs with $5,000 coming from members and another $5,000 from a Kickstarter project. This will allow us to have at least three months of assets to pay bills and acquire equipment. I know this seems daunting but I'm absolutely sure we can raise this money. I'm going to be putting in money myself to help get the space. Many of the members whose primary interests include electronics or hardware are looking to finally have a workshop. The workshop will include benches and tools for projects. It will have a place to store projects that are just too large for your apartment. At HI Capacity, you will be available to show off your cool new hack or great design. It's a social group in a more industrial setting.

I've heard feedback that the developers may not see value in having a permanent space. Many developers do just fine moving from one coffee shop to another, or just staying home. HI Capacity is offering a central meeting place for developers. This will allow you share ideas, learn from each other or show off your next big idea. We'll be setting aside a quieter area for coders to meet and hang out. Membership will include access to both the workshop and the coder's room.

We will be holding a member's meeting on Thursday, August 11th at 6PM. This will be our initial fundraising event. You can meet all of the members and we'll show you the plans we've been working on to get a space.

There will be food and drinks at this event. I'm expecting up to 50 people to show up, so there will be a lot of food.

The event will be at:
<address>
220 South King Street (Corner of King &amp; Alakea)<br/>
Room 1603 (16th floor)<br/>
Honolulu, HI 96818

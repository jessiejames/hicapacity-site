This is just a reminder that the November NodeSchool.io meetup is happening on November 4th! Everyone is invited to come. Whether you're new to Node or a seasoned Node dev, feel free to come down and try out some of the workshops available.

Note that they will be continuing from where they finished last time. However, they will try to get anyone that is new up to speed with the problem sets.

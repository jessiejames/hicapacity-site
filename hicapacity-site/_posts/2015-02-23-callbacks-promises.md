Writing Asynchronous code in JavaScript can often times be confusing. JavaScript callbacks allow you to handle concurrency by offering to run a function at the end of another function with the return values of the previous function. But callbacks come with a few downsides. The code needs to be well thought out for it to be easy to read. Nested callback often lead to highly indented and hard to read code and pushes novice developers into spaghetti code. It's the most controversial feature in JavaScript. 

Promises to the rescue! Or is it? It's a new feature in ES6, or the next version of JavaScript, and will be hitting evergreen browsers soon. Promises is a new tool that allows developers to replace callbacks with a thenable. What's a thenable? Come to the talk and find out!  

I'll also cover how to use it now rather than wait till all the browsers adopt it. 

How to keep the flow of control within one function while reaching out to many others. 

How to convert code (and whole libraries) from callbacks to promises and back.

How to keep your code tidy with Promises.

Finally, advanced tips and tricks with Promises.

We just confirmed one more event that's coming up. For this talk Paola Saibene, the CIO of the Hawaii Libraries will give a talk on some of the benefits of the public library system that you may not already know about. The talk will be on Tuesday June 12th 7pm at HI Capacity (inside The Box Jelly).

HSPLS (Hawaii State Public Library System) is the only library system in the world to offer free world-wide access to certification-path IT courses from Microsoft. From Office Suite to Architectural Design of Datacenters, a patron conceivably could develop an IT career through the library system. With an unprecedented approach to educating our state and communities, HSPLS understands that libraries will need to step up to the challenge of filling in an educational gap in order to better equip our citizens for workforce development. “HI Tech Academy” is the umbrella program that hopes to include a myriad of educational paths, remaining as vendor inclusive as possible that will enrich the technological knowledge of our patrons “from keiki to kupuna”. HSPLS is open to ideas, assistance, and civic involvement in the course of elevating the technical expertise of our communities.

The talk will be held at The Box Jelly (Inside Fishcake furniture store) at 307c Kamani Street, Honolulu, HI 96813 on May 22nd, starting at 7:00pm. Parking is available at Sports Authority (owned by the same land owner). There is also street parking around the neighborhood.

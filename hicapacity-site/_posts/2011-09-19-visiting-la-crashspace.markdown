On a recent visit to the LA Crashspace, Steve Goldstein gave me a
tour of the 1500 square foot space that included a conference room, multiple
machinery rooms, a storage area with unused machines, an area for
snacks/drinks, and a bathroom/shower. He even demoed some of the cool gadgets
they have been working. I even got a laser cutter demo!

Quite the sight to see.

Taking a look at their space confirms my feeling that it's <em>very</em> possible to
open a similar space in Honolulu. After all, Crash isn't some hacker
castle filled with mythical coders and makers. It's a building with walls,
tools and people just like you and me.

Here at HI Capacity, we're working extemely hard to get a space up and running
as quickly as possible. Our goal right now is to get a space with a table and
some chairs. A place whose focus will be to build a community of do-ers
producing cool things. We may not have all the tools and space lke Crash in the
beginning. That's OK, the machines will eventually come.

What we will have in place is the right culture to get things done.

Our vision is to create a maker ecosystem like LA Crashspace.
With everyone's contribution, we'll create something amazing - A vibrant
community of creatives coming together to teach, make, inspire and do.

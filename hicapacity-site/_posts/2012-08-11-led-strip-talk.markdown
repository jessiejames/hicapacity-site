Come this Tuesday, August 14th to learn how to program an LED light strip! This particular LED strip is individually addressable and can make 4 million different colors. If you haven't seen it in person, it is really impressive! The talk will discuss how to do different cool effects on the LED strip and incorporate data from sensors.  We’ll go over some basic Arduino programming as well to help you get on running quickly.

This is the LED strip that we will be using. You don’t need to buy one right now, we will have several there to play with although you may need to share them. If you have an Arduino and/or a laptop please bring them!

In April this year, Linode (a VPS provider) was hacked. The group that hacked them used a ColdFusion exploit to break into their servers. I
want to show you how to do the exact same thing (on our own servers of course). First, we'll go over the story behind the hack, then we'll
get into the hack and show a live demo of the hack. I'll show you how you can replicate the hack and how it works. I'll also show you how a
simple node.js app can be exploited to do a similar hack as well.

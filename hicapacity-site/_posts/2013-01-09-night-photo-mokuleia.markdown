Bob Matcuk will talk about preparing your camera settings to take photos at night. Please bring your camera and a tripod (if you have one). We will be taking practice photos outside after the talk. This introductory talk is to prepare us for our night photography project that will take place over the next few months.

So, please join us and learn more about night photo so you can help us with a collaborative art and arduino project. We will share details at the event.
Parking may be hard to find on Kamani street, so please consider parking at the Sports Authority Parking Lot (off of Ward Ave.)

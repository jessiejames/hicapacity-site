<p style="float: left; "><img src="http://heartmycity.me/images/logo2.png" alt="HeartMyCity icon" /></p>Startup Weekend Honolulu was a blast. Over a 54 hour period we designed, developed and launched a (mostly) working website! I worked on <a href="http://heartmycity.me/">HeartMyCity</a>, we help people submit reports about their city, such as potholes, grafiti, and trash so that the city or other community members can fix it. It was a blast working with my team members Burt Lum (<a title="@bytemarks" href="https://twitter.com/#!/Bytemarks">@bytemarks</a>) and Patrick Kelly (<a title="@phlatphrog" href="https://twitter.com/#!/phlatphrog">@phlatphrog</a>) and I'm proud to report that we actually came in 2nd place! Over the weekend Patrick and I developed a functioning Android App and website while Burt worked on the business side of things.

<p style="text-align: right;">Two other HI Capacity members also participated, Austen Ito (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/austenito">@austenito</a>) and James Wang (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/synthes1s">@synthes1s</a>) helped to build the website <a title="justkudos.com" href="http://www.justkudos.com">justkudos.com</a> which helps you find the best dish at a restaurant. Just Kudos is nice because it is really simple and was built using the Foursquare.com API so nearly all Hawaii restaurants are already in the list.</p>

<a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup weekend</a> is a non-profit that helps run events focused on launching a startup over an intense weekend. Startup weekend brings together developers, business people, designers, marketers, and other startup enthusiasts to build the core of a business over the weekend.

I also wanted to give a quick shout-out to some of my other favorite teams: <a href="http://www.ohanamala.com/">Ohana Mala</a> who are giving socially-concious consumers a simple and fast way to find fresh local food and Great Health Options who are helping uninsured americans find the best prices on medical care.

Check out <a href="http://honolulu.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend Honolulu</a> for the full list of teams! We also need to thank Daniel Sherman (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/SocialWahines">@SocialWahines</a>) and Dave Pascua (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/808Dave">@808Dave</a>) for helping organize and run the event. They're looking for other people to help organize the next event if you're interested.

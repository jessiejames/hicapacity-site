<strong>Tired of your &lt;insert your version control system here&gt;?</strong>
<br/></br/>
<a href="http://hicapacity.org/img/wp-uploads/2011/05/github_logo.jpg" class="pirobox" rel="single" title="GitHub Logo"><img class="imgRight" title="github_logo" src="/img/wp-uploads/2011/05/github_logo.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="160" /></a>

If you're a developer, you've probably seen the hullabaloo about distributed version control systems over the past few years. While you might have dismissed it as a passing fad, it's definitely a tool that every modern programmer should have in their tool belt.

Still using Subversion? Still can't commit offline? Tired of slowww branching? Want to participate in the largest social coding website, evar? If you answered yes to any of those questions, you'll definitely want to join us on May 24th from 7pm to 9pm at Oceanit to learn how you too can start using <a title="Git" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> and <a title="GitHub" href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>. <a title="Jason's Home" href="http://jaxelson.com" target="_blank">Jason Axelson</a>, a security developer at <a title="Referentia" href="http://www.referentia.com/ " target="_blank">Referentia</a>, and Ryan Kanno, a software engineer at <a title="Civil Beat" href="http://www.civilbeat.com" target="_blank">Civil Beat</a>, will be going over the basics of git and how to get started on Github.
<br/><br/>
They'll be covering such topics as:
<ol>

Come and learn how to use git to collaborate on any of the 2 million Github projects. Based on interest, we'll be following this presentation with a more advanced presentation in a few weeks that will cover advanced topics of git such as interactive adding, bisecting, and rebasing. The talk should last about 1 to 1.5 hours. At the end of this session, we hope to have you up and running and playing around with git.
<br/><br/>
If you plan to attend this meeting, you should definitely bring a laptop. Also, please, please try to install git prior to our meetup. If you need help, feel free to jump on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/honolulu-hackerspace" target="_blank">HI Capacity Google Group</a> and ask questions!

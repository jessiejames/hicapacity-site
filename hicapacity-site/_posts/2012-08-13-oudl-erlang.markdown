Please take a moment to watch this Erlang video:

I'll wait while you watch.  Really.

OK?

George Lee, of Ikayzo, will then discuss Erlang.  He's working with it quite a bit and needs to share.

Erlang is awesome.  Just knowing what Erlang is increases your IQ by 20 points.  This is much like using the word "meta" in a sentence.
Try it!

Amusing, dramatic description to come.

As a warm-up, Jason Axelson will give us a quick review of highlights from DEFCON 2012.

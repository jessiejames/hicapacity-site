Come join HICapacity one last time before finals! Students can engage with professionals on topics ranging from managing a work/life balance, tips on advancing your career, to the best spots to eat around where you work. It is a great opportunity for students to ask all the questions they've been meaning to ask people in the field. Professionals can network with other professionals and finally catch up with those they've been meaning to. They can also get to know the future professionals who will soon be out in the workforce.

If you haven't heard about HICapacity, this is also the perfect time to find out about this dedicated group of individuals. We are a community of professionals from all walks of life, Hardware, Software, and the Arts, committed to sharing our knowledge with others and helping to evolve the technical industry in Hawaii. We host social events, technical presentations, and soft skill workshops that support building a vibrant technology sector in Hawaii while also trying to enrich other sectors with our skills in technology. We cater to all skill levels from the hobbyist to the most senior developer.


We'll be serving drinks and food too. You'll have a good time.

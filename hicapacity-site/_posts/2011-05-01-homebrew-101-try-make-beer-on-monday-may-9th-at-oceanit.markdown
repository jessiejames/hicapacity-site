<strong>Attention all Oahu beer drinkers... we listened! No beer in da ear!</strong>

<strong><a href="http://hicapacity.org/img/wp-uploads/2011/04/fyb_up.jpg" rel="single" class="pirobox" title="Front Yard Brews"><img class="imgRight" title="Front Yard Brews" src="/img/wp-uploads/2011/04/fyb_up-286x300.jpg" alt="Front Yard Brews" width="229" height="240" /></a></strong>

We know that Hawaii is the biggest beer drinking state per capita in the country. And we know nobody likes to pay $5 bucks for that green bottle, so why not learn how to make your own?

As our first Community Night, in coordination with award winning <a title="Front Yard Brews" href="http://www.frontyardbrews.com/">Front Yard Brews</a>, we present:

<strong>Homebrew 101: Try make beer?</strong>
<div>If you're tired of drinking those Bud Lights, this is where you want to be! Come join Front Yard Brews, winner of first place in the American Ale category at the <a title="Kona Brewers Festival" href="http://www.konabrewersfestival.com/Contest.html">2011 Kona Brewers Festival Homebrew Competition</a>, on May 9th from 7 PM to 9 PM at Oceanit to learn how you too can make your own award winning beer!</div>
<div>Justin and Sunny from Front Yard Brews will be going over the basics of the homebrew process - from start to finish. They'll be covering such topics as:</div>
<br/>
<div>
<ol>
	<li>What equipment will I need?</li>
	<li>How to choose a recipe</li>
	<li>The brewing process</li>
	<li>How to bottle your brewski</li>
</ol>
The talk should last about 45 minutes. At the end, we'll enjoy a small sample of a special brew they're currently making for HI Capacity! There will be bottles of Front Yard Brews' "Rusty But Trusty Red" for you to take home. And... if there's significant interest in replicating the process for your own home, Justin and Sunny will be hosting additional, more-detailed nights at a later date to help get you started.

</div>
We've limited this event to the first 40 people.

Warning: May include functional programming and excessive Playgrounds.

A little bit of time has gone by since our last Swift meetup. It's time to regroup and have a discussion on Swift.

The agenda is simple:

* Discuss interesting Swift language features, guided by suggestions or led by my Playgrounds
* Go over the GitHub project that I've put together to guide the PNM workshop in March (beta testing!)

Our focus will be on guided discussion and writing a lot of code together.

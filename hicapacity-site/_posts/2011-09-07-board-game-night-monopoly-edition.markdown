Like Monopoly, but can't stand how long it takes? Did you know there are official rules that make the game much shorter, but that you've probably never heard of?

Come to IGDA Honolulu's Monopoly Edition of our regular board game nights and learn how to play Monopoly as it was intended - and in far less time than you thought possible! If that's not enough, there'll also be the Monopoly card game on hand!

This time, we'll be at The Box Jelly on 307 Kamani Street. Parking is available across the street, or by Sports Authority. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/event.php?eid=280350521979091">RSVP here</a>.

As always, you're free to bring whatever games you want! If Monopoly isn't your thing, we'll also have other award-winning games on hand, including Carcassone, Dominion, &amp; Ticket to Ride.

See you there!

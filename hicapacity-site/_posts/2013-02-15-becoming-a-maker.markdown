HICapacity will be the featured program for this month's Wetware Wednesday.  If you haven't been down to HICap in some time or want to see some of the interesting projects some other members have been working on, please come to this event.  Free food and beer will be provided.  In fact, some of our very own members are currently brewing some of the beer you'll be enjoying that night.

## Why should you go? ##

__Featured presentations__ - topics ranging from Arduinos to IOS apps to bamboo bikes

__Sensory Overload__ - Raspberry Pis get your electronic taste buds watering but we'll be using them to stimulate your remaining senses.

__Interactive Demos__ - 3D printers printing, Kinects connecting and Leap motions... leaping? Don't worry they'll be cool stuff to see.

__Free Food and Beer__ - Need we say more...

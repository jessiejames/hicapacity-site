It's that time again, the Organization for the Understanding Dynamic* Languages is meeting:

*And sometimes less dynamic languages that are cool.

Talk #2: Haskell - An introduction
Thursday - May 24, 2012 - 7pm by Tim Newsham

The Haskell programming language is unique, challenging and inspiring. Haskell is notable for its strong, static type system, its “lazy” evaluation and its adherence to strict functional purity. Programming in Haskell is very different from programming in C- and Lisp-like languages most programmers are familiar with. Simply learning Haskell can be a mind-expanding experience.

In this talk we will get a glimpse of Haskell, discuss what makes it unique and compare its features with those in other languages.

Some manner of pastry will be served.  I am giddy with excitement to finally learn Haskell.  So come prepared with questions, or just come prepared to have your mind melted (either way - both can be fun). Please sign up on our meetup page to get involved: [http://www.meetup.com/dynamic](http://www.meetup.com/dynamic)

Located at the Box Jelly 307c Kamani Street, inside Fishcake

Further planned talks:

* Functional Python - By Shu Zong Chen
* Clojure - An intro, setup w/ Emacs, Slime, Leiningen - by Kyle

Please forward to anyone you think might be interested.

In General:
This series of talks aims to bring discussion and learning of interesting programming topics to Honolulu, not by importing speakers or exporting programmers (to/from the mainland), but by harnessing and growing our own talents locally. Think of it a first-rate programming conference, happening in slow motion, spread out across several months.

All participants are encouraged to present some material. Topics will be covered in talks and workshops by the members of this group. Subjects will come from a cohesive set of dynamic language concepts.

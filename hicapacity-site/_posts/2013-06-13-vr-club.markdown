Virtual Reality is making a comeback. If you've ever wanted to be IN the game, fully immersed like never before, you'll want to join HI Capacity and IGDA Honolulu for Hawaii VR Club's First Meetup.
The Oculus Rift is a new device that delivers a virtual reality experience that once cost thousands of dollars. We have two Oculus Rifts (and accompanying dev kits), and we'll be demonstrating the technology for the local community. To further stoke interest in developers and designers for the new platform, we'll have a pair of talks about the Oculus Rift, virtual reality, and how Hawaii developers have the opportunity to get involved early creating for this innovative hardware.
 
See you there!

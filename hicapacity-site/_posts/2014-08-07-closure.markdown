Hey everyone, this is just a quick note that the BoxJelly will be shutting down today (Thursday Aug, 7th) at 2pm. They will be closed until Sunday and will provide another update on Sunday as to what will be happening next week. Check for updates on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/BoxJelly). This also means that HICapacity will be closed and will not reopen until the BoxJelly does. If you need anything from the space please retrieve it before 2pm today. Please note that equipment and boxes have been moved off the floor because of flooding concerns. You will not be able to work in the HICap area as all desk and table surfaces are now covered in equipment.

Stay safe everyone and we'll see you next week!

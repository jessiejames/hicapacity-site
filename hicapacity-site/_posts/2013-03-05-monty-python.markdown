Message for you, sir!

Aloha you silly English Knnnnnnig-hts and sons of a silly person!

The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite held aloft Monty Python and the Holy Grail from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that we, HI Capacity, were to watch it on Sunday, March 10th at noon.

The Knights of Ni demand it! In addition to shrubberies and snacks. Some that taste good. And not too expensive.

So come, see the violence inherent in the system! You may even be turned into a newt!... But it'll get better.

We shall use our finest projector!

P.S. If you should see a small white rabbit, do not approach it or make any sudden movements. Slowly back away and inform the nearest aaauuuggghhh...

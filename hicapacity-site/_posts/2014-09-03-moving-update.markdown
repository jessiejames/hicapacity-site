Hey everyone, we've managed to move most of our things over to the MIC! The only things remaining are some miscellaneous boxes, chairs, and the smaller desk that the MakerBot resides on. We managed to move the lockers and large wooden table earlier today. At this time we're announcing that __HICapacity at the BoxJelly is now closed__. Only those who are helping us pack, move, or clean up the space should be there. We're hoping the last of our paperwork will come through by the end of this week so that the space can officially open up at the Manoa Innovation Center.

We thank you all for your understanding as we await our exciting new space. We would also like to thank everyone who has loaned us a hand, equipment, or vechicle to make this move possible. We're grateful for everything everyone has done for us.

Keep checking back, we will update again soon!

Hello everyone! We are very excited to announce the opening of HICapacity at MIC! We're still trying to figure out access details so if you're planning on coming down please let one of the following people know: Jesse, Ed, James, Julie, Bob, Trevor, or Noah. We will try to make sure that the space will be open at the time you are planning on coming down. Please note that for this week, and most likely next, the space will still be in a disarray. We are trying to unpack and setup the furniture. If you come to the space during this time, you will be recruited to help. Regularly scheduled will resume shortly. We will let you all know when this happens.

Our new address is:

    2800 Woodlawn Drive Suite #132
    Honolulu, Hawaii 96822

Note that our suite number is __132__. The placard by the door should be updated shortly by MIC with our name.

Thank you all for your patience! We're really sorry that the paperwork took a little longer than we had hoped. But we're excited to see you all back in our new space! We will be having an official grand opening party sometime in the near future so stay tuned for that. We will send out the official invitations and information when we've worked out the details.

See you all soon!

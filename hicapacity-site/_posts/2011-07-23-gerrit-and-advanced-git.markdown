<br/>
We will show how using gerrit with git will help you make code review an integral--and easy--part of your everyday workflow. We will also show how to integrate an automated continuous integration tool to catch build errors for each commit before they reach the main repository. Gerrit will also help enforce a level of uniformity in quality and formatting of your code. With Gerrit you can be proactive instead of reactive.
<br/><br/>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Work on a project with a team? Tired of integrating code into a code base with build errors? Writing code that relies on bugs to actually function correctly?</span>
<br/><br/>
Then come on down to our meeting, and bring a laptop. Also, please, please experiment with git prior to our meetup. If you need help, feel free to jump on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/honolulu-hackerspace">HI Capacity Google Group</a> and ask questions!

Aloha! We're going to hold a beginner's workshop on the Arduino on Wednesday, October 3rd at 7PM. It'll be at the HI Capacity space and free and open to the public! No membership required!

This will be a beginner's workshop on the Arduino Microcontroller. An Arduino is a small computer designed to help bring electronics to a wide variety of projects and a greater audience. The Arduino is made to be easy to use and easy to learn.

We will introduce basic electronics concepts and get you to start working on your Arduino immediately!

There will be several Arduinos at the space for you to use if you don't own one. All you'll be required to bring is a laptop! You can buy a new Arduino starter kit at Sparkfun.com or Adafruit.com. Unfortunately, at this time, we don't have any Arduinos for sale at the space.

Good evening, as some of you have noticed, we've got a new image showing up on the right side of the web page. That's our crowd-sourced funding widget! That will show you the current progress of our funding.

It originally said $10,000 but it did not account for the funding already contributed. So, I've reduced the total on the widget to $8,500. Click on the link to donate!

Our goal is $10,000 but we can start a minimum space at $5,000. Here are some examples of the funding levels:

$5,000 - Start moving into space with minimum equipment and basic furniture

$6,000 - Buy small tools and storage for the space

$7,000 - Buy projector for presentations and more furniture

$8,000 - Extra breathing for bills or more equipment :-)

$9,000 - Computer monitors and a couple of desks for programming hardware and software

$10,000 - Buy refrigerator/espresso machine for use by members (Caffeine, yay!)

Go click on the widget today so that we can build out our space!

<div>HI Capacity has been steam rolling along in attempts to find and unite the 'makers' and 'creators' on island. Ultimately, our goal is to have a self-sustaining Makerspace in Honolulu, funded primarily through it's members via a tiered membership. Recently, there's a co-working movement that's been happening on island with the advent of such businesses such as <a href="http://theboxjelly.com/" target="_blank">The Box Jelly</a>, <a href="http://www.higreenhouse.com/" target="_blank">HI Green House</a> and <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/Interisland-Terminal" target="_blank">R&amp;D from InterIslandTerminal</a>. However, while I love the co-working movement, I think our Makerspace is unique to the islands because we've reached out and have really connected the technical talent on island.Here's an update of what we've been up to these past few months (We've been really busy) :
<ul>
	<li>Giving cutting-edge technical talks on the <a href="http://hicapacity.org/2011/08/06/arduino-night-iv/" target="_blank">Arduino</a>, <a href="http://hicapacity.org/2011/07/23/gerrit-and-advanced-git/" target="_blank">Git/Gerrit</a>, and Node.js with <a href="http://aloharb.org/" target="_blank">Aloha.rb</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://hicapacity.org/img/wp-uploads/2011/08/IMG_1256.jpg" target="_blank">Programmers meeting weekly</a> at Petals and Beans</li>
	<li>Working on <a href="https://github.com/hicapacity/foodtrucks" target="_blank">Eat the Street Mobile</a>. Web app, iPhone and Android</li>
	<li>Giving talks at the inaugural <a href="http://ignitehonolulu.com/" target="_blank">Ignite Honolulu</a></li>
	<li>Entering two teams in the global competition <a href="http://nodeknockout.com/" target="_blank">Node Knockout</a></li>
	<li>Participated in the inaugural <a href="http://honolulu.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend Honolulu</a></li>
</ul>
Ultimately the goal of any Makerspace is to find a physical space for it's community.

<strong>That day has finally arrived!</strong>

<strong></strong>On Monday October 10, HI Capacity will be opening an interim Makerspace in The Box Jelly while we search for a more permanent home. In the meantime, if you become a member you'll have access to the following:
<ul>
	<li>Space to work on software/hardware projects. Soldering is allowed.</li>
	<li>A limited amount of storage space to store your projects.</li>
	<li>Comfortable chairs and tables.</li>
	<li>Whiteboards.</li>
	<li>A community of people that want to do things!</li>
</ul>
We plan to move to a new location in the near future with added benefits for our members. Please check out our <a href="http://hicapacity.org/membership" target="_blank">Membership Page</a> for more information about membership or to subscribe!

We will also be having an All-Hands Meeting on Tuesday October 4th at 6:30 pm. You can take a tour of the space and we'll be covering the following topics:
<ul>
	<li>Membership</li>
	<li>Hours of operations</li>
	<li>Guidelines</li>
	<li>Restrictions</li>
	<li><strong>Vision for HI Capacity and our future Makerspace</strong></li>

I am glad to announce a Homebrew beer talk next Thursday 8/9 at 7pm!
 
This talk will cover the basics of all-grain brewing, and demonstrate uses of automation in the brewing process. A homemade, electric-powered brewing system that fits in even a tiny condo will be presented and discussed with what worked, what didn't, and how it could be improved.

The speaker is Jason Forester.

Parking is either on the street or at Sports Authority.

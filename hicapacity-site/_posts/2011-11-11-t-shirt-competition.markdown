Hello everybody! Sorry for the late post. We're officially launching the T-shirt competition sponsored by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moxie3innovations">moxie3innovations</a> (@moxie3innovatio)

If you don't know who or what we are, you may be unsure what kind of design you can make. We're looking for something that demonstrates our personality.
<div>We're a technology focused organization with a passion for making and inventing things. In essence, we're a bunch of geeks with a creative passion for technology. We would like to include this ideological 'maker' persona in the design. Something that can encapsulate our current logo or expand upon it with a maker/hacker style. <a title="Hackerspace" href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace" target="_blank">Here's a Wikipedia</a> article explaining what a Hackerspace to help you.

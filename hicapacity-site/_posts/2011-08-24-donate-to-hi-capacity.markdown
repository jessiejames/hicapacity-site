Hello everybody! We're always trying to move the HI Capacity forward. Most people don't really see the business behind it but we're trying to change that. We're going to keep you up to date on our progress more in the future. We are writing business plans and projections. We're determining the best price point for membership and looking at generating revenue from other sources. We're also looking to get capital to start the space.

We need all of this to prove that we're a legitimate entity. We're here to make an awesome maker space and absolutely serious about doing so. Whether you're a developer, interested in making your own homebrew beer, an electronics hacker or just want to make things, we'll be the space in Honolulu that you'll want to go to.

We have tons of <a title="Dealios Chrome Extension" href="http://hicapacity.org/2011/08/22/dealios-the-groupon-like-chrome-extension/" target="_blank">projects</a> you can help with or you can <a title="Google Moderator" href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=724ef" target="_blank">create your own</a>. Because we have so many projects going on, we need a space. We're going to try to partner up with <a title="The Box Jelly" href="http://theboxjelly.com/" target="_blank">The Box Jelly</a>. They have the business expertise to help us find a space and help us determine a good plan of action to keep HI Capacity sustainable.

Most of all though, we need your help. We need your assistance funding the space and the build out. This is going to take considerable effort on our part to get the space that you desire. Please click the donate button at the bottom of this post to help us bootstrap HI Capacity into one of the best makerspaces in the country.

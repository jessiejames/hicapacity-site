_Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more. -- docker.io_

<br/><br/>
Developers are key to any business invested into technology. They are the heart and soul of getting the product off the ground. However traditionally, systems are kept up by admininistrators and ops people. Good developers write code that's useful for production and great developers are able to reproduce the production infrastructure in development.

As a newcomer to Docker, one can simply think about this piece of technology as being a lightweight VM that is cheap to create, destroy, and even share. Synonymously think about how Git has changed the world of software development by being distributed and incredibly cheap and quick to do things that were not done in the past.

Technology advancements allow for newly revised workflows optimizing speed of integration between development versus production and allows for testing and accurate visibility.

This is a talk for administrators and developers.

Demos:

* Web servers/applications
* Databases
* Deployment
* Various software services
* Container linking

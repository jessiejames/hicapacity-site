Trevor Alexander, HICapacity member and Student Liaison, will give an informal technical talk about backpack, an 'information introspection application' developed at Startup Weekend with the help of a couple of UH student biz devs, a tenacious student from DevLeague (hi Eun Joo!), and some punks from Sudokrew (hi Manny! hi Matt!). Expect bad jokes, terrible commit messages, sappy reminiscence, shoutouts to the community, and maybe even a little lucid code review!

Everyone loves Git.  But, not everyone loves their Git workflow.  Let's see how we can share what we know to make the world a better place for Git users.

Git is a requirement for most programming jobs (unless you're Shu and you like Git *AND* Mercurial).  Get educated.  Share your L337 HaX0r skillz.

Main Goals of this talk:

1. Level-up experienced programmers' everyday Git skills.

2. Beginners will learn to incorporate a simple Git workflow into their daily routine.

Proposed Format:

1) Basic Git intro (just in case)

- What it is
- Why you should use it
- How it works

2) Workflow Demos

- A simple basic one
- Distributed, single user
- Distributed, multi-user

3) Tips and Tricks (time permitting)

The Workflow Demos will follow a TBD pattern, such as:

* slide representing a visual diagram of the workflow, or brief explanation
* working through a use case
* questions / improv

__When:__ Thursday, January 24, 2013 @ 7pm to 9pm

__Where:__ HI Capacity (in the Box Jelly), 307a Kamani Street Honolulu, 96813. (Please park on Ward Ave, Kamani street, or surrounding street parking).

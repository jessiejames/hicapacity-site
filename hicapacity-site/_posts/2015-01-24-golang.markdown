James Wang will be giving a talk on <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> this coming Thursday!

Go is an exciting programming language that is aimed to replace C in many ways. From groundbreaking benchmarks to Erlang-like concurrency focused language constructs make it one of the go to languages for code that demand performance.

From Goâ€™s Documentation:

The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

The agenda for this talk is as follows:

* Environment Setup
* Getting Started: Simple Programs and Algorithms
* Concurrency & Design Patterns
* Tools and Projects written in Go

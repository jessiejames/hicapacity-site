Good evening everyone!

I would like to invite everyone to attend our Arduino Night IV on August 17th at 6:30PM! We'll be learning about sending and receiving commands from your Arduino to your computer. The goal of the night will be making a program to send a command to the Arduino, making another program to receive commands from the Arduino and bidirectional command transmission.

Since the night will focus on sending and receiving commands using a computer, you should bring a laptop. At our previous nights, many of the attendees were more than willing to share, so don't let that stop you from attending! I'm willing to share my laptop. :) A laptop is not required to attend!

I apologize for the late notice but I was hoping that Arduino ethernet shields would arrive by the time of the meet. Unfortunately, they will be delayed, so I had to shift the topic of discussion. Don't worry, we'll do a twittering Arduino in the future. ;-)

(The attendance information is the same from our last meet):

All attendees who want to participate in the demonstration will need to buy an Arduino kit from Adafruit Industries: <a href="http://bit.ly/i9RlbZ" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/i9RlbZ</a>

The kits at Adafruit sell out quick! You can purchase either of these kits from Sparkfun. <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10174" target="_blank">Starter kit is $59.95</a> or the <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10173" target="_blank">Inventor's kit is $94.95</a> Personally, I would recommend the Inventor's kit. :)

The price of the kit will run between $50 and $100, depending which one you purchase (with an additional $10 for shipping). Please order this ASAP if you want to attend as it should take about 3-5 business days to get to Hawaii. If you came to our last meeting, you won't have to purchase anything! :D

<strong>Note: We'll be building on this kit in future - so think of it as an investment!</strong>

Oceanit (<a href="http://www.oceanit.com">http://www.oceanit.com/</a>) has graciously provided their conference rooms for us to use for our very first meetup. They are located at 828 Fort Street in Downtown Honolulu. (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Oceanit+Laboratories+Inc.,+Honolulu,+HI&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=21.309466,-157.863386&amp;sspn=0.010195,0.01929&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Oceanit+Laboratories+Inc.&amp;hnear=Oceanit+Laboratories+Inc.,+828+Fort+Street+Mall+Suite+600,+Honolulu,+Hawaii+96813&amp;z=14">Google Maps link</a>) Parking to Oceanit is on Queen St. If you're coming down Bishop, take a right on Queen, and the entrance will be on your right after a wide crosswalk. (If you hit Harbor Court, you've gone too far). It's $2 dollars for parking through Park &amp; Pay on each floor. Sometimes the terminal doesn't take credit, so try to bring cash or coin.

<strong>Hope to see you there!</strong>

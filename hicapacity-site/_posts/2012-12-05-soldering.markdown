We'll be doing an incredibly fun beginner's soldering workshop where you will learn how to solder a really cool LED Christmas tree.

__No tools or experience is necessary, but feel free to bring your own.__

After this lesson, you'll be ready to solder on your own.

__What the workshop will cover:__

- A quick safety introduction
- Basic soldering concepts and how-tos. We will be practicing on PCBs. 
- Then we will be building an LED Christmas tree!

It'll have blinky lights and will be a gift for you to take home! It's an ornament you can show off your DIY skills with your family, friends and coworkers.

__Cost__

$30

This event is different than our free events. Your payment will help us cover the following:

- Equipment costs (solder, soldering irons)
- The LED Christmas tree ornament costs roughly $20 with shipping
- Any remaining profit will directly towards improving our current and future Makerspace.

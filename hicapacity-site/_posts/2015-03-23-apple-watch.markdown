James Wang will be giving a talk on the Apple Watch!

The Apple Watch is an exciting new product that has the potential to make a huge impact on technology wearables. James will be going over the fundamentals and guidelines on iOS development with the Apple Watch. The product is not yet released, and this is a very early introduction for what’s to come! Check out this OUDL event on development with the Apple Watch. Although programming experience is not required, we’ll be showing some Objective-C and Swift code.

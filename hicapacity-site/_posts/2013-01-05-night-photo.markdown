Aloha, 
Join us this Friday for our first Night Photography session following our first Night Photography 101 talk this past Tuesday evening.

A bunch of us will be meeting at 6pm to grab some food together around the Ward area. We'll then meet up at HI Capacity around 7:30pm to grab our camera equipment and then leave from here. 
You can park at Sports Authority if you plan to join up for dinner at 6pm but before we head out to North shore you should probably plan on moving your car to the street if you will not be driving.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact <a href=mailto:marion@hicapacity.org>marion@hicapacity.org</a>
 
What to bring:

* Camera
* Tripod
* Jacket (waterproof)
* Sweater
* Jeans (advised)
* Headlamp or flashlight
* Toilet Paper
* Food
* Drinks

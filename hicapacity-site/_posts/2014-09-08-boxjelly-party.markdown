Hello everyone! The BoxJelly is throwing us a going away party! It will this week Friday, September 12th from 6pm to 9pm. Come down and hang out with everyone!

If you are interested in attending, please RVSP on the Facebook event at: [https://www.facebook.com/events/369352703215121/](https://www.facebook.com/events/369352703215121/).

##### To the BoxJelly: #####
We would like to thank all of you at the BoxJelly for everything you've done for us over the last 3 years! We'll always remember our beginnings at the back of Fishcake, which wouldn't have been possible without the generosity of the BoxJelly. We've both come a long way together and it has been a fun journey. Even though we won't physically be at the BoxJelly, we are intent on keeping the relationships and friends we have made there over the last few years. If you guys ever need anything, you know where to find us :). Don't hesistate to stop in and say hi if you're in the Manoa area! Thank you again, we'll miss you guys!

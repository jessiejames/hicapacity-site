Quilling, also known as paper filigree, is the manipulation of paper strip coils to create designs. This art form back to the Renaissance period but has seen a recent revival. Quilling is now used to create all sorts of art including cards, wedding invitations, home decor, and even 3D items. The paper coils and strips can create delicate flowers, elegant lines that mimic vector illustrations, and illusions of depth and texture.
 
This workshop will go over the basics of quilling including the tools of the trade, beginner techniques and shapes, and conclude with a crafting session to create typographic art that you can take with you. The workshop is run by Suann Chen, an advertising MFA student, avid DIY-er, crafter, and hobby artist.
 
While the workshop is free, you will need some inexpensive supplies.
If you would like to purchase supplies at the workshop for $5, please RSVP by Friday, August 17th. The talk will be held on Thursday August 23rd at 6:00pm at HI Capacity.

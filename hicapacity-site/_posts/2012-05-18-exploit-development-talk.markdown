I'm excited to announce the third HI Capacity security night! See below for the description.

Come see a circus act of exploit development!  No PowerPoints, prepare for nonstop action packed demos!!

Here are some of the things we will cover:

* Fuzzing for bugs
* Buffer overflow development
* IDS & antivirus avoidance
* Password hash cracking
* Client side document exploit
* Cross site scripting
* Local & remote file inclusions
* Sql injection
* Windows fails aka features

Bring your evil thinking caps and ask lots of questions.  The only way to write safer code is to understand how it could be exploited.

The talk will be held at The Box Jelly (Inside Fishcake furniture store) at 307c Kamani Street, Honolulu, HI 96813 on May 22nd, starting at 7:00pm. Parking is available at Sports Authority (owned by the same land owner). There is also street parking around the neighborhood. The speaker is HI Capacity member Tony Dow.

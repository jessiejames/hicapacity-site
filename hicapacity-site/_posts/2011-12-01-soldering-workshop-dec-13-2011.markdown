We'll be doing an incredibly fun beginner's soldering workshop led by Jeremy Chan. Jeremy Chan is an experienced electrical engineer working at the Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory.

<strong>No tools or experience is necessary, but feel free to bring your own.</strong>

After this lesson, you'll be ready to solder on your own.

<strong>What the workshop will cover:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A quick safety introduction</li>
	<li>Basic soldering concepts and how-tos. We will be practicing on PCBs.</li>
	<li>Then we will be building an LED Christmas tree!</li>
</ul>

It'll have blinky lights and will be a gift for you to take home! It's an ornament you can show off your DIY skills with your family, friends and coworkers.

<em>"That looks really cool, where did you buy it?", </em>they'll say<em>. </em>

<em>"I made it myself" </em>responding with a grin.

<em>
</em><strong>Cost</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">$45 for members</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">$55 for non-members</p>
This event is different than our free events. Your payment will help us cover the following:
<ul>
	<li>Equipment costs (solder, soldering irons)</li>
	<li>Using the The Box Jelly space. Because we are having a paid event, we will be renting the space. The rate is $280 for 3 hours or 1/3 of our profits, which ever amount is less.</li>
	<li>The LED Christmas tree ornament costs roughly $20 with shipping</li>
	<li>Any remaining profit will directly towards improving our current and future Makerspace.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Where and When</strong>

The workshop will be on December 13th at The Box Jelly. It will be at 7PM.

Intimidated by the video game controllers of today? Wish you could grab a hold of a joystick and play those games from your childhood? Want to just have FUN?

HI Capacity in conjunction with The <a title="Honolulu IGDA Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/IGDA-Honolulu/149048338496095">Honolulu Chapter</a> of the International Game Developer's Association (@<a href="http://twitter.com/igdahonolulu">igdahonolulu</a> and @<a title="Gorm Lai's Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/gormlai">gormlai</a>) and the RetroGameGeeks of Honolulu (@<a title="Ryan Araki's Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/arakiryan">arakiryan</a> and @<a title="Marc Orbito's Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/marcorbito">marcorbito</a>) present:

<strong>Retro + Obscure Gaming Night!</strong>

If you're a gamer that's passionate about video games, you'll definitely want to join us on June 13th from 7pm to 9pm at Halsey Terrace!

Come and learn about 6 games that will rock your world - but you've <em>probably never heard of.</em> The evening will begin with a series of small talks about lesser known games, after which people will be able to walk around and play at our small, ad-hoc mini-arcade. We encourage you to bring your own games (BYOG) to step-up and play from your childhood in our designated Retro arcade room!

We'll also be playing such classic hits as:
<ul>
	<li>Donkey Kong</li>
	<li>Pac-Man</li>
	<li>Street Fighter II</li>
	<li>Gauntlet</li>
</ul>
If you would like to RSVP to this event, you'll need to RSVP on <a title="Retro + Obscure Gaming Night" href="http://twtvite.com/r2eluc">Twtvite</a>.

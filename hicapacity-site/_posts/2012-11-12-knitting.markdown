HI Capacity is continuing to learn how to knit! Join us for another beginner's workshop -- this time about purling. If you attended the last one, you'll learn the next step: purling, which will be an integral part of your knitting skill repertoire. If you missed the last workshop, or already knit and just want a refresher, we can teach you to cast on and knit, too.
Once you know the two primary stitches -- knit and purl -- you're well on your way to being able to create almost anything. Those two types of stitches are the foundations for any pattern or shape you can imagine.
 
We'll continue knitting a square or rectangle to keep it simple -- it can become a dishcloth, a phone cozy once folded oven and sewn, or a myriad of other things. If you attended last time, bring the supplies you purchased. If you're new, RSVP with the "new knitter" ticket so we can buy supplies. You'll get knitting needles and a ball of cotton yarn for the $6 you bring in cash.
 
This workshop will be co-taught by Bethany and Kat!

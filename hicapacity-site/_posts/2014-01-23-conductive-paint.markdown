Hello everyone! We will be doing our second condutive paint workshop! If you want to see what we did at the first one check out our photos on Facebook [here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.566785600053490.1073741830.138211559577565). This time around we will be doing the same house again so if you attended the first one this may not be as interesting for you. But you're still welcome to join us again if you like!

Interested in learning about simple circuits? Enjoy making things light up? Join us for our conductive paint workshop!

This is a simple project where art meets electronics. We'll be decorating and designing paper houses and lighting them up using conductive paint! No wires or soldering involved here! 

In addition, Bob will be doing a little electronics 101 to explain how the circuit works and why things work the way they do. From there you can light up any mini project of your own using conductive paint!

We've done a couple sample houses. Check them out here:

For this workshop we will be providing a kit with all the pieces necessary to make one of these houses. The fee for the workshop is $5 to cover the cost of the parts in the kit. We will also provide Xacto knives, scissors, and markers to cut out and decorate your houses. However, we may not have enough to go around at once so if you want to bring your own Xacto knives and markers feel free to do so.

__NOTE: Please bring $5 in exact change to the workshop for the kit! We are not accepting payment online this time.__

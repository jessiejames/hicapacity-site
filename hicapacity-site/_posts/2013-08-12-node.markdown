Node.js is Javascript runtime for the server-side that is based on Google Chrome's V8 Javascript engine. Its popularity and use have taken off in the past 2 years due to its surprising performance advantages over other scripting languages. Its event loop concurrency model is similar to those that are used in Nginx, Python's Twisted, and Ruby's EventMachine. Javascript on the server side allows complicated server-side products to be written with a minimal amount of code.

This talk will cover the following topics:

* [Common.js Modules](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html)
* [HTTP](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html)
* [Streams API](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html)
* [Debugging](http://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html)
* [NPM](https://npmjs.org) - community based package manager for modules
* [Node.js Knockout](http://nodeknockout.com) past experiences

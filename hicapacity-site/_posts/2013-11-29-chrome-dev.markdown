HICapacity is hosting a new (possibly monthly) event where we take a deep dive into public web pages with Chrome Dev Tools. The point is to look at what works well and what doesn't work so well when trying to develop high traffic web pages for the public. We hope that through this we can find common patterns among quality web pages, discover interesting solutions to difficult problems, and maybe even some quick fixes that were overlooked.  

We'll also be exploring how to effectively use Chrome Dev Tools to debug your web page. Dev Tools offers a complete suite of tools including a HTML and JS debugger with breakpoints on both JS code and DOM events, a FPS (Frames per Second) counter, and much much more. I'll be walking through some of the tools that I know how to use and when to use them effectively. 

This event was inspired by the later half of this YouTube video (Colt's Talk): [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Bafn-pr2s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Bafn-pr2s)

What's Required:

* Please bring your own laptop with the Chrome web browser installed. So you can follow along.
* An open mind. 

Optional:

* A few web sites for us to look at. Feel free to suggest your own website and maybe we can find a few trick to help speed up your site or tweak the UI/UX. 

We would like this to be an informal discussion so be prepared to offer your own insight and opinions.

Do you have a domain? More than one? If so, you'll fit right in at DOTCOM, a new discussion and support group for domain hoarders collectors hosted by HICapacity at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/BoxJelly/@21.296687,-157.856515,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x7c006e0820771d41:0xbf7fee287e045e6f" target="_new">Box Jelly</a>.

We'll start with a short presentation about domains, and then circle up to do fast-paced introductions of domains we've had ideas for.
Whether you hope to restart a project, find a good home for a domain, or just make us laugh, be ready to say a little bit about your own when it appears in the slides.
We hope you'll stay for the refreshments, too, and make a new connection or two.

Please RSVP <a href="http://domainnight.eventbrite.com">here</a>.

During registration, please submit up to 4 domains that you'd like to speak about.  Additionally, feel free to send up to one image to <a href="mailto:rsvp@domainnight.com">rsvp@domainnight.com</a>  by April 12th for each domain/group of domains if that would help explain it.

Git has rapidly become the standard in distributed source control. Find out how to use it, and while we're at at, what's this GitHub stuff all about?

Jason Axelson ([http://hicapacity.org](http://hicapacity.org)) will introduce you to the Git version control system. He'll also cover GitHub, and how you can begin using it today.

If there's time after the talk, we can take questions and perhaps share some l337 hax0r Git tips among the crowd. Also, consider this a good segue to our GitHub speaker in September.

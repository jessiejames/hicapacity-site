Trevor Alexander, HICapacity member and UH student liaison, will be giving an
informal technical talk about [rBCI](https://www.github.com/talexand/rbci), a
tool for quickly validating brain-computer interfaces. The first half of the
talk will be concerned with the background, purpose, and implications of
hackerspaces and BCI, while the second half of the talk will focus on the code,
design, and implementation of rBCI.

Bring your brain, your computer, and let's interface!

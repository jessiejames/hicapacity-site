The Hawaii VR group and HICAPACITY have released the first version of their Oculus Rift and Leap Motion enabled VR Demo Scene.
Using a [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) you can grab food objects and bring them to the camera for fun munching action. Press 2 to load the [Oculus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com) enabled scene. The scene also features image based lighting using [Marmoset SkyShop](http://www.marmoset.co/skyshop) using an image of the actual 
HICAPACITY space in the Box Jelly.

We've also uploaded an android build of the scene so you can view the space on an android enabled mobile device.

For those of you without a Leap Motion or Oculus HIVR, we will be demoing this scene at the [Honolulu Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfairehonolulu.com/) on March 15, 2014 at
'Iolani School.

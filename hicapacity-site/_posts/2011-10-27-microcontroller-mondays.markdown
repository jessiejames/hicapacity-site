Good evening everyone! Unfortunately, I haven't been unable to make it to a lot of events lately including tonight's Kinect talk. (I heard it was packed though!) One of the things we've had planned for the past few weeks was Microcontroller Mondays. I haven't been able to make it, so I don't think a lot of you knew what it was or that it even existed. It's a slight adaptation from other Maker/Hackerspaces, if you've been to one before.
The idea behind our Microcontroller Mondays is that people show up with an electronics project they made, want to make or are currently in the process of making. On Mondays, it would be a hack night. Much like the programmers had a Saturday weekly meetup, this was intended for more of the hardware crowd to show off their projects and spread ideas. It's also more than just a show and tell, it's a hack night! We don't discriminate against the types of microcontrollers you'd like to hack. Anything that's cool and and exciting is welcome. Hell, even the uncool and boring is welcome.
We've got tools such as soldering irons, helping hands, magnifying glasses. So you shouldn't have to bring any large tools. Here's a list of our tools: <a href="http://wiki.hicapacity.org/index.php?title=Wish_List" target="_blank">http://wiki.hicapacity.org/<wbr>index.php?title=Wish_List</wbr></a>

Starting this Monday (yes, Halloween!), we'll be doing the (in)formal weekly meetup. I'm going to go buy a silly Halloween toy and try to hack it to do something cool. I haven't found one yet, so let's talk ideas. Maybe something like<a href="http://hackaday.com/2011/10/27/crawling-zombie-is-shockingly-creepy/" target="_blank"> this</a>?

I'm also going to bring candy because I love candy. And it's Halloween, so I have an excuse to buy a bunch of it.

On Monday at 7PM at The Box Jelly, come join us and create something awesome!

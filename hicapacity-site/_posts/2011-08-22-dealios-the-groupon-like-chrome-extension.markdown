HI Capacity has just released <a title="Dealios" href="http://bit.ly/chrome-dealios">Dealios</a>, the chrome extension allowing you to view deal sites from the comfort of your browser. No longer will you have to rush to your email inbox or RSS feed reader to figure out what's the hot deals for today.

Features include:
<ul>
	<li>Honolulu supports Hot Deals Hawaii, Groupon, Living Social</li>
	<li>Chicago supports Groupon</li>
	<li>Extension icon changes color to notify you when a new deal is posted</li>
</ul>
We've also pushed the <a href="https://github.com/hicapacity/dealios">Dealios source code</a> up to the HI Capacity GitHub account. Like any project, there's always room for improvement. Go ahead and fork the repository and add your city or additional deal sites, create a deal site API for the chrome extension to use, anything you can imagine.

HI Capacity wants you to push tech forward. Making improvements to Dealios is just one way to get there.

Happy Hacking!

Are you scared of the command line? Then this talk is for you. The goal of the talk is to teach the absolute basics of the command line. How to use it, get around, and manage files. There will also be tips to make the most out of your time on the command line. The idea is to become familiar with the command line to make good use of programs that require/benefit from it such as git.
 
The speaker for this talk is Jason Axelson; a local software developer locally that loves to work on the command line and uses Linux for his day-to-day work when possible. If this talk goes well there will be intermediate and advanced command line talks.

The talk will be on Wednesday May 8th, at 7:00pm at HI Capacity (inside The Box Jelly). Address is 307a Kamani st, Honolulu 96813. This talk is open to the public.

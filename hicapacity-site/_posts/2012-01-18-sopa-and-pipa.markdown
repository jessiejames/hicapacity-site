I try to take a neutral stance towards politics at HI Capacity. I don't want politics to get in the way of our creativity and our movement. The moment someone doesn't agree with what you believe in, they'll start dismissing your ideas and slowly..... dismiss you completely. How can you become a fair leader when you dismiss your constituents?

These bills are too broad and would allow for censorship on the internet, stifling our entrepreneurship in Hawaii and all over the United States. A technical examination of the bills proves that even with the best intentions to block piracy, those with nefarious intents can still censor.

When legislature gets in the way of our civil liberties we must act. Last night The Greenhouse Innovation Hub hosted a session on SOPA. While I wasn't there, I can assure you that the message is clear. We need to contact our legislature and show them our concerns. There are other ways to stop piracy and counterfeiting than blocking web pages.

I contacted Senator Akaka in November to protest the PROTECT-IP act. Here's what he had to say

Dear Mr. Badeau:
</p><p>
Thank you for contacting me regarding S. 968, the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011, also known as the PROTECT IP Act of 2011.
</p><br/><p>
As you may know, S. 968 was introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) on May 12, 2011. This measure would authorize the Attorney General (AG) or an intellectual property right owner harmed by an Internet site dedicated to infringing activities (ISDIA) to commence an action against a registrant of an ISDIA's domain name or an owner or operator of an ISDIA accessed through a domain name. In addition, the bill authorizes the AG to commence action against individuals associated with nondomestic domain names. Following the commencement of such an action, the court is allowed to issue a temporary restraining order or injunctions against the nondomestic domain name, registrants, or the owner or operator of an ISDIA. On May 26, 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported the bill to the full Senate where it was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar.
</p><br/><p>
I support the bill's intent of ensuring the protection of intellectual property. However, in doing so we must ensure that we do not hinder the free-flow of information or stifle innovation. Rest assured I will keep your concerns in mind should the Senate consider S. 968 or related legislation in the 112th Congress. Mahalo again for contacting me.

Aloha pumehana,
</p><br/><p>
DANIEL K. AKAKA
</p><br/><p>
U.S. Senator

I urge you to contact Senators Daniel Akaka and Daniel Inouye and protest the PROTECT-IP act in the senate. Contact Rep. Colleen Hanabusa and Rep. Mazie K. Hirono to protest SOPA. Their stance is currently unknown but have received money from lobbyists in the entertainment industry. Call their office, send them an email, write on their Facebook wall. This will be the only way to change their opinions.

Nate Kowahl has volunteered our first talk in the MatLab data crunching series. Big data is upon us. This means munging that data set of yours is going to be an ever increasing important part of your geek life (if it isn't already).

Nate will describe the processes he uses, from data import/parse, to classification/performance validation, using Matlab. He'll cover the basic data types and tools in Matlab while touching on data cleanup, feature selection, classification, and cross validation. Most of this talk will be high level, leaving specifics up for discussion as needed.

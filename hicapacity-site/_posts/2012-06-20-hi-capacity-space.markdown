Hey makers,
 
Things are moving forward at HI Capacity, I am proud to announce that we will be getting a dedicated space within a month! We are aiming to be fully moved in by early July. We will be moving in to the current Box Jelly space and they will be expanding to take over the whole side store that is parallel to Fishcake. Since we are a member-funded organization that means that our monthly fees will increase by $15/month to handle the increased rent and utilities. So the standard price is changing from $35 -> $50 and the premium "help us grow" membership is changing from $50 -> $75. But if you are signed up by the end of June you will be able to keep the current prices for 6 months so sign up now!
 
With the dedicated space we will have expanded hours and finally be able to get some more serious equipment. We do not have any specific equipment purchases planned yet but we're hoping to get a smaller cnc mill or lathe. Additionally a few members have equipment that they were willing to donate.
 
As a reminder here are some the things we have right now:

* Community! Meet cool people and those who pass through!
* Space for doing projects
* High-speed wireless internet
* HD Projector (for giving talks)
* Soldering tools (soldering irons, helping hands, solder)
* 3D Printers (MakerBot)
* iPhone Developers License

We will be taking over a majority of the current Box Jelly space and will be able to utilize it 24/7. However, we will still be able to use the rest of the Box Jelly after hours (good for the programmers).
 
As part of the move, there will be a wall built between our area and the fishcake. HI Capacity will have to pay for the build out of the wall along with an AC unit (since we can no longer share the Fishcake's unit). This build-out will cost a significant amount of money so we are planning a fundraiser to help pay for it and some equipment for the space.
 
This is an exciting time, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

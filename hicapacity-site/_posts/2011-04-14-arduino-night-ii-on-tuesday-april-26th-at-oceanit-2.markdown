Get ready for our second ever HI Capacity Honolulu Hackerspace meeting.

We only have room for 40 so sign up fast! :)

Please RSVP on Facebook: <a style="white-space: nowrap;" href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=160964560631900" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=160964560631900</a>

<a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=160964560631900" target="_blank"></a>For our second Arduino night, we'll be making an ambient box out of paper! We'll be using the RGB LEDs and light sensor that came with the budget pack.  If you didn't purchase the budget pack from the first meetup, fret not, you can still order one today!   The toy will detect ambient light and change brightness accordingly. The toy will also cycle through different colors.   We'll also be going through some of the math involved so that you can make your own circuits!  We'll also be talking about the expansion of the Hackerspace to include Homebrew and Programming Night!

All attendees who want to participate in the demonstration will need to buy an Arduino kit from <del>Adafruit Industries: <a href="http://bit.ly/i9RlbZ" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/i9RlbZ</a></del>

<strong>UPDATE: </strong>Apparently, the kits at Adafruit are sold out, so you can purchase either of these kits from Sparkfun. <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10174" target="_blank">Starter kit is $59.95</a> or the <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10173" target="_blank">Inventor's kit is $94.95</a> Personally, I would recommend the Inventor's kit. :)

<a href="http://bit.ly/i9RlbZ" target="_blank"></a>The price of the kit will run between $50 and $100, depending which one you purchase (with an additional $10 for shipping). Please order this ASAP if you want to attend as it should take about 3-5 business days to get to Hawaii. If you came to our first meeting, you won't have to purchase anything! :D

<strong>Note: We'll be building on this kit in future - so think of it as an investment!</strong>

Oceanit (<a href="http://www.oceanit.com">http://www.oceanit.com/</a>) has graciously provided their conference rooms for us to use for our very first meetup. They are located at 828 Fort Street in Downtown Honolulu. (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Oceanit+Laboratories+Inc.,+Honolulu,+HI&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=21.309466,-157.863386&amp;sspn=0.010195,0.01929&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Oceanit+Laboratories+Inc.&amp;hnear=Oceanit+Laboratories+Inc.,+828+Fort+Street+Mall+Suite+600,+Honolulu,+Hawaii+96813&amp;z=14">Google Maps link</a>) Parking to Oceanit is on Queen St. If you're coming down Bishop, take a right on Queen, and the entrance will be on your right after a wide crosswalk. (If you hit Harbor Court, you've gone too far). It's $2 dollars for parking through Park &amp; Pay on each floor.

<strong>Hope to see you there!</strong>

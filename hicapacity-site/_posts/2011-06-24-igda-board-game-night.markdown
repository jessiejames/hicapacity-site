For our third game night on Thursday, June 30 from 7PM to 11PM, we'll be at:

Petals &amp; Beans
1288 Ala Moana Boulevard

(<a title="Google Map" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=1288+Ala+Moana+Blvd+petals+and+beans&amp;hl=en&amp;cid=16688401627082036617">Google Map</a>)

Like last time, we will try to bring a few games that we can play, but if you have something you would really like us to try, please bring them. If this is your first time attending, we're just a bunch of gaming enthusiasts that love to play games. In our previous game nights, we played Settlers of Catan and Blockus. Bring a new game to teach people or join an existing game for a night of friendly competition! :)

The official closing time is 11:00, which is when we expect to be done, but you are of course, welcome to stay longer if you want (or at least until our host kicks us out :-) )

Feel free to <a title="Facebook RSVP" href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=153355684738012">RSVP on our Facebook invite</a> so we have a general idea of how many people are coming!

Hope to see you there!

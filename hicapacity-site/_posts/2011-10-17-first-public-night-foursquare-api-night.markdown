<strong>Horray!</strong> First public night since opening! What does that mean?

Everyone is invited to a night of an interesting software development talk. You don't have to be a software professional to come and learn from some intriguing examples.
<blockquote><em>But what is this all for?</em></blockquote>
APIs are the way to leverage other services, not too much to chew off for someone trying to do something cool with programming, and a good way to get involved with something cool. So we're going to strive for a <strong>single-day hackathon every month</strong>. At the start of next month, we'll be having a first ever API hackathon, "<strong>HI Consumption</strong>", featuring the FourSquare API and tentatively on <del>Sunday, November 6</del> <strong>(changed to) Saturday, November 5</strong>.

Every month we're going to learn a new API, write some code, and think about how to use it or mash it up with other APIs to come up with something awesome.

<strong>So please!</strong>

<strong></strong>On Wednesday night come check us out, you don't have to be a member! Come by listen to us talk briefly about the API. We'll show some examples and show you guys how to get started.

This is just a <strong>taste</strong> of what's coming and a "<em>free sample</em>" to whet your appetites for you non-members. For you members, there will be another in-depth workshop (<strong>members only</strong>, $10 for non-members) on the FourSquare API coming up in about a week or two (TBA).

<em>Don't procrastinate!</em>

For those you who are eager, <a title="FourSquare Resources" href="http://hicapacity.org/foursquare-resources/">here</a> are some resources to get started!

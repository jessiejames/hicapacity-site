Announcing: A meetup for Honolulu-based dynamic programming language enthusiasts

Dynamic language features, concepts, and implementations in multiple languages will be presented in talks and workshops. All languages are welcome, but this group will initially focus on: Objective-C, Haskell, Python, Clojure, Ruby and Javascript.

All participants are encouraged to present some material. Topics will be covered in talks and workshops by the members of this group. Subjects will come from a cohesive set of dynamic language concepts.

This series of talks aims to bring discussion and learning of interesting programming topics to Honolulu, not by importing speakers or exporting programmers (to/from the mainland), but by harnessing and growing our own talents locally.  Think of it a first-rate programming conference, happening in slow motion, spread out across several months.

Some manner of pastry will be served.

Please sign up on our meetup page to get involved:

Detailed descriptions of upcoming talks:

Talk #1:
- by Kyle Oba
Dynamic Languages - They're not just for Rubyists (and Pythonistas)... Being the platform language for iOS development, Objective-C has recently exploded in popularity (http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/paperinfo/tpci/Objective-C.html). One reason it makes developers so productive is that it supports many dynamic programming concepts.

This talk will highlight the Objective-C runtime, and how it implements some of the language's interesting and useful features (message passing, key-value-observing, categories, etc).

Talk #2:
- by Tim Newsham
The Haskell programming language is unique, challenging and inspiring. Haskell is notable for its strong, static type system, its "lazy" evaluation and its adherence to strict functional purity.  Programming in Haskell is very different from programming in C- and Lisp-like languages most programmers are familiar with.  Simply learning Haskell can be a mind-expanding experience.

In this talk we will get a glimpse of Haskell, discuss what makes it unique and compare its features with those in other languages.

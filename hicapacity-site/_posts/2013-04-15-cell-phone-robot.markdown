Good evening! Tim Heath, one of our super smart HI Capacity members, is volunteering to host a workshop to create a cell phone controlled robot! It's pretty amazing.

Tim writes: "Learn how to turn your cellphone into an inexpensive robot that you can control anywhere in the world using the MyRobot platform!  If you want to actually create your own robot using a cellphone you can either buy a kit at the workshop or bring your own parts.  At the least you will need a phone with serial output, a microprocessor (Arduino) to accept DTFM or serial input, serial break out board for your phone (if not using DTFM), two motors/servos for one castor wheel for motion etcâ€¦  You will also learn how to create a robot chassis using blender and a RepRap machine.  Email Tim at wgheath@gmail.com if you have any questions."

HI Capacity has a printrbot 3D printer for members to use to print the chassis, if needed.

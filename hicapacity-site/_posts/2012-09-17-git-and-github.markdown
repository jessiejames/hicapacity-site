GitHub.com is the place for open source developers to collaborate on their projects. But there's a perception that GitHub and Git are the domain of Mac and *nix users. Not so! In this talk, Phil Haack, a GitHub employee, will show how GitHub makes open source collaboration fun and tools and techniques for using Git with GitHub on Windows.

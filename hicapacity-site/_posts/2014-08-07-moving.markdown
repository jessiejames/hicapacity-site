Hey everyone, we have some big news to share. 

#### HICapacity will be moving to a new space! ####

The details are still forthcoming and we will be updating everyone as they arise. What we do know for sure is that we need to be out of our current space by September 1st, which is coming up fast! We are trying our hardest to minimize the amount of downtime for our members but we do need your help cleaning up the space and moving things over to the new space.

Here is a list of things we need help with: 

* If anyone is available to help move things or to help temporarily store some items at their homes, we would be grateful. 
* We are planning to organize a clean-up day to pack up and move things out. If you are willing to help, let us know!
* If you have left anything at the space, we advise that you stop by soon and pick it up. We are planning to get rid of a lot of things during the move so if you've left anything at the space, please pick it up if you don't want it to be potentially discarded. 
* If you currently have a locker in the space please come down and take your items home with you for safekeeping. We don't yet know if we will be moving the lockers to the new location.

It is going to be a crazy next few weeks but stay tuned!

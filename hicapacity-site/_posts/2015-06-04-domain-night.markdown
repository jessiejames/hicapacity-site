Do you have a domain? More than one?  If so, you'll fit right in at DOTCOM, a new discussion and support group for domain hoarders collectors.

We also welcome people who would like to get started.  If you're curious what this is all about, come for the intro session at 5:30, and we can help you buy your first domain, or answer any questions you may have.  

At 6:30, we'll have a short talk about domains, and then circle up to do fast-paced introductions of domains we have had ideas for.  Whether you hope to restart a project, find a good home for a domain, or just make us laugh, be ready to say a little bit about your own when it appears in the slides.  We hope you'll stay for the refreshments, too, and make a new connection or two.  

To participate, please RSVP on Eventbrite and submit your list of up to 5 domain names.  Feel free to send up to one image for each domain/group of domains to rsvp@domainnight.com if that would help explain it, and we'll add that to your slide.  

Parking Tips: There's a great municipal lot (single level, well lit) on the left side of Beretania just after Nuuanu, and also usually plenty of street parking.  Look for the Loading Zone signs (most are ok after 4pm) and spots on Bethel (mauka of Merchant) that switch from being tow-away at 5:30pm.  

5:30-6:30pm Getting Started With Domains
6:30-8pm Domain Night Discussion (with slides like last time)

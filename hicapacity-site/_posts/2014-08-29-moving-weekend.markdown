Hey everyone, if you don't already know, we're moving to the __Manoa Innovation Center__! We're sorry for not officially announcing it sooner, but we wanted to make sure we were further along in the process before announcing it. While we are moving this weekend, we cannot officially open at MIC until a few more things come through. MIC is allowing us to borrow the key this weekend to start storing stuff in our new space. We must vacate our current space at the BoxJelly by the 15th at the very latest, but we really want to be fully moved out by the 1st. If anyone is available to help this weekend please get in contact with Ed or myself soon. Or post on our Facebook page and one of us will get back to you.

At this time we are entering into our transitional period. We will be trying to move some of the larger pieces of furniture this weekend so the usage of the current HICAP space will be very limited starting next week. We will continue to post updates on Facebook and on our website to notify our members when we will officially cease operations at the BoxJelly and open at the MIC. We are working as fast as we can to get everything finalized so please stay tuned!

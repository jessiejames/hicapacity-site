Hello everyone! It appears that some of our members were super excited and have unpacked and reassembled the furniture in two days! The space is sane enough to officially open it up to everyone and to start resuming normal events. The weekly events will all take place at our space at MIC. Other events may vary in location. They could either be in an MIC meeting room, in the space, or at the BoxJelly. Please make sure you check the location for our events carefully! Both Hardware Tuesdays and Programming Thursdays are resuming immediately (for members only). Special talks and events will resume shortly. We will post about those here soon.

Since we're up and running we're ready to announce our grand opening party! It will be on Friday, October 10th from 5pm until 8pm at our new space at the Manoa Innovation Center. Food will be provided by Slickage. If you plan to attend please RSVP on EventBrite so we have a better idea of how much food we need to order. We ask that HICAP members also RSVP please!

__Where:__ 2800 Woodlawn Drive, Suite 132, Honolulu, HI 96822 [[map]](https://goo.gl/maps/UBHN3)

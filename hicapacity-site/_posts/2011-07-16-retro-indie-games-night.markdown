IGDA Honolulu, in association with HI Capacity &amp; RetroGameGeeks, are happy to announce the next:

Retro + Indie Games Night!

Monday July 25th 7:30 pm
Halsey Terrace
620 Pool Street

Come check out a collection of lesser known and indie games that'll blow you away -- ranging from experimental games to educational games to just plain great games. The night will start with a series of short talks to introduce eachtitle, after which guests are invited to try them out at our own ad-hoc mini-arcade. In addition, take a trip down memory lane and play all your old favorite arcade games in our retro game rooms!

Feel free to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=210404852339622">RSVP on our Facebook page</a>. See you all there!

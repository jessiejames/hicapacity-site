First, a brief talk to get you motivated and inspired to get thrifty and crafty this holiday season followed by a round-robin of fun crafting projects that are easy (and delicious!) to do. The workshop will be run by Suann and Bethany and costs $5 (in cash) to attend, but you will get things to take home after!
